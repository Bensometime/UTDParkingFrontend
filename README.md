# UTD Parking Frontend

## Introduction

This application is intended to provide a front-end for data retrieved from
[this api](https://github.com/codes4coffee/utdParkingAPI), which scrapes the
number of available spots of each parking pass type in each parking structure
on campus. It is very much a work in progress and as of this commit does not
function. At the point where the project is functional enough to strictly
complete it's intended function, I will begin building it to github pages.
